# Get to Know Me 

<p>Enjoy designing websites and have a passion for front-end development. Using Visual Studio, I built the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating and deploying this website allowed me to deepen my understanding of web app design and explore both front-end and back-end development. The most rewarding part of this project was the joy of bringing my own creation to life and sharing it with the world.</p>
