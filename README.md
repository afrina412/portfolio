<p>Hello! I'm Nurul Afrina Binti Abdul Rahim, a passionate Computer Science student with hands-on experience in software engineering, system maintenance, and web technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in various impactful projects, such as developing an E-Shipping system to enhance logistics efficiency and creating an IoT-based gas leak detection system. My internships have further strengthened my skills in debugging, programming, and system optimization. With a continuous drive to learn and innovate, I aim to contribute to the tech industry by developing solutions that address real-world challenges, improve system performance, and deliver exceptional user experiences.</p>

# Get to Know Me 

<p>Enjoy designing websites and have a passion for front-end development. Using Visual Studio, I built the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating and deploying this website allowed me to deepen my understanding of web app design and explore both front-end and back-end development. The most rewarding part of this project was the joy of bringing my own creation to life and sharing it with the world.</p>

# MyPast Project

  <h3>E-Shipping System</h3>
</a>
<p>During my internship at SMT Technologies, I collaborated with the team to design and develop an E-Shipping system aimed at streamlining the company's logistics processes. Using ASP.NET and VB.NET, we enhanced system functionality, improving efficiency and reducing manual workload. My role involved thorough testing and debugging to ensure optimal performance and usability, ultimately contributing to smoother and more efficient operations within the organization.</p>

<h3>EcoAlert with Gas Leak Detection and Automonitoring</h3>
</a>
For my bachelor project, I developed EcoAlert, an IoT-based system designed to monitor and prevent LPG gas leaks. Using C++ and gas sensors, the system continuously monitored gas levels and provided automatic alerts in case of leakage, enhancing safety measures. This innovative project was well-received for its practical application in reducing the risks associated with gas leaks, showcasing my ability to integrate IoT technology with safety solutions.

<h3>Color Blindness Detection System</h3>
</a>
<p>As part of my diploma project, I developed a Color Blindness Detection System to assist individuals with color vision deficiencies. Implemented in C++, this project was awarded the Gold Medal for Innovation at the iCompex competition, supported by MDEC. The system provided a user-friendly way to diagnose color blindness, demonstrating my ability to create impactful solutions that address specific health challenges with technological innovation.</p>
